This is my portfolio website written with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

It took a lot of time for me to push this out. The struggle to build a perfect portfolio website continues ðŸ˜Š, at least I have a starting point now.

<!-- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). -->

## Cloning

Feel free to clone, modify and use this template as you wish but kindly remove all my personal information.

## Getting Started

This project uses [Clash Grotesk](https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/clash-grotesk) and [IBM Plex Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Sans?query=ibm+plex+sans&sort=date) available through [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

<!-- This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font. -->
