We recommend using **Static Generation** (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.

```css title="Sample CSS code"
.blog-post h2 {
    font-weight: 500;
    font-size: 1.8rem;
    margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
    margin-top: 2rem;
    line-height: 2rem;
}
```

A clear example of the refined SQL is as follows:

```sql title="Sample SQL code" showLineNumbers
SELECT p.id
FROM Person p
    JOIN address a ON p.Id = a.Person_ID
    JOIN address_type at ON a.Type_ID = at.Id
    JOIN `option` o ON p.Id = o.person_Id
    JOIN option_address_type oat ON o.id = oat.option_id
WHERE a.country_id = 1 AND at.id <> oat.type_id;
```


### From Cover to Cover

You can use Static `Generation` for many types of pages, including:

- Marketing pages
- Blog posts
- E-commerce product listings
- Help and documentation

> You should ask yourself: "Can I pre-render this page **ahead** of a user's request?" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.

On the other hand, Static Generation is **not** a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.

In that case, you can use **Server-Side Rendering**. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data.
